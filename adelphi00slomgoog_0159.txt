985. prolubium [pro-lubet], ‘ whim,’ a word not found in any
classical author. This line is apparently adapted from a verse of

Caecilius,
“ Quod prolubium, quae voluptas, quae te lactat largitas ?
A very early variant is proluvium, explained by N onius as ‘ ex·

, travagance’ (profusio), found in B (2² D G and read by Donatus,

Nonius, aud Servius. Proluvium is certainly easier thau prolubium in
this context, but the parallel passage in Caecilius is too close to be
disregarded, especially when we consider that prolubium might easily
be turned into proluvium, while the reverse could hardly take place.
Translate, ‘what means this new whim of yours‚ this sudden liberality θ’

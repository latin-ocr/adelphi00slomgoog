became merely a generic name for improvised songS, not
always very refined, at weddings‚ triumphS, or other festal
occasmns.

Saturae. According to Livy 7. 2, the first ‘ludi scenici’
were introduced at Rome 361 B.c. to appease the anger of the
gods who had sent a pestilence on the city.

It seems certain that about this time a stage was erected in
the Circus at the Ludi Maximi, and the first three days of the
festival were henceforth occupied with recitationS, musiC‚ and
dancing. Performers from Etruria, called ῖαιῆοηεε, danced to
the music of the flute without words or descriptive action 3 but
the strolling minstrels of Latium (grassatores, spatiatores) soon
took advantage of the stage to recite their chants with appro-

their miscellaneous character Satur-ael. They were composed
in the rugged Saturnian mette, with no connected plot, and did
not admit of dialogue.

Fabulae Atellanae. A nearer approach to dramatic form
was made in the Fabulae Atellanae, broad farces with stock
characters, e. g. Maccus, PappuS, Bucco, and Dossenus, ana-

pantomime. Each character had its traditional mask, and the
pieces were originally played only by amateurs at private

—Poenaque lata, malo qnae nollet carmine quemquam

Describi: vertere modum formidine fustis

Ad bene dicendum delectandumque redacti.

and Persius, were introduced by Lucilius, who died 103 Β. c. cf. Hor.

ROMAN COMEDY AND TERENCE. xv

of Plautus, were C omoediae palliatae, i. e. plays wherein the
scene and characters are Greek, as opposed to comoediae togatae,
where the scene is laid in Rome or at least in Italy. National
tragedies and dramas were called Fabulae Praetextae.
Terence's first comedy, the Andria, was produced 166 B.C.
Suetonius relates that when this play was offered to the AedileS,
the young author was told to submit it to the judgment of
Caecilius. Terence arrived when the veteran poet was at supper,
and being in mean attire was seated on a stool near the table.
But he had read no more than a few lineS, when Caecilius bade
him take a place upon his conch, and bestowed high commenda—
tion on the play. As Caecilius died in 168 B.c., the Andria
must have been in manuscript at least two years before its per-
formance, and some colour is given to the above anecdote by
the mention which Terence makes in the Prologue of the ill-
natured criticisms of Luscius Lanuvinus. The Hecyra, his second
play, proved his least successful one. At its first performance
in 165 B.C.‚ the audience deserted the theatre to look at some
boxers; a similar fate attended a second representation in
160 B.C., and only the persona] intercession of. the manager,
Ambivius Turpi0‚ secured it a hearing at all. The Heauton
Timorumenos appeared in 163, the Eunuchus and Phormio in
161, the Adelphi in 160. In the same year Terence visited
Greece‚ either to study for himself Athenian manners and
customs‚ or, as some assert‚ to escape the persecution of his
enemieS. According to one account¹ he perished by shipwreck
in 159 B.C., as he was returning to Italy with no less than 108 of
Menander’s comedies translated into Latin. A more general

Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existumant,
Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, quom illis placet,
Qui vobis univorsis et populo placent,
Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio
Suo quisque tempore usust sine superbia.
Adelphi Prol. 15-21.

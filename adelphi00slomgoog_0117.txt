School Lat. Gr. 5 751. ·
eausam meditari, ‘to get up your case.’ meditari-2 ‘to practise,'

396. dum, ‘nntil‚’ is often found, even in Cicero, with a pres. ind.
when the future action is represented as certain, especially after verbs of
‘ waiting.’ Cf. 785, Andr. 329 prqfer (nuptias) dum prqficiscor, ib. 714,
Phor. 982.

198. domo me eripuit. See note at beginning of this scene.

199. plus (minus and amplius also), when joined to numerals, is used
with or without quam, and without influence on the construction.

infregitz illisit, inflixit (Don.).
All MSS. place line 200 of this edition before line 199. All
editors agree in the transposition.

200. tantidem . . . tradier=tradier tantidem quanti empta est, ‘ to
be handed over to him at cost price.’ The archaic form in -ier of the
pres inf. pass, is often used by poets. The final ·er is probably the
sign of the passive, but the history of its origin and change into the
later form is quite uncertain. Cf. 273, 535, 607.

201. verum enim, ‘ but indeed,’ cf. 168 note.

202. hariolor, ‘1 am talking nonsense.’ Cf. Phor. 492. The sig-
nificant change in the meaning of this verb shows pretty clearly into

νομαι and μαντική are connected. Cf. Plato, Phaedr. 245 Β, C.

203. ubi me dixero dare =ubi dixero me daturum esse mulierem
Aeschino, Terence not unfrequently uses the pres. inf. after verbs of pro-
mising, saying, etc. ‚ where we should expect the fut. inf. The same con-
struction is occasionally found in prose writers of the Augustan age. Cf.
Caes. Β. G. 4. 21 pollicentur obsides dare. Cic. Rosc. Am. ξ 12, supra 128.

204. Sannio means that, if he agrees to sell the girl, he will not be
able to prosecute Aeschinus for her violent abduction, while his chance
of getting the purchase-money will be remote.

somnium, ‘ moon-shine.' Cf. 395.

205. id, sc. the delay.

206. eum quaestum, ‘that businesa' i. e. of slave-dealing.

inceperim so all MSS. Many editors occeperis.

208. has rationes puto, ⁶ 1 make these calculations! Cf. 796 note.

ACT ΙΙ. 8οΕΝΕ 2.

AeschinuS‚ knowing that he might fare ill were Sannio to prosecute
him, sends out SyruS, a crafty slave, to arrange matters. Owing to
complications in his affairs Sannio cannot afford to delay for a law-suit,

Aer ΙΙ. scum: 1.

Aeschinus, after breaking into Sannio's house, carries off the music·
girl, with whom Ctesipho is in love. Sannio endeavours to prevent her
. being taken into! Micio’s house, but only gets soundly cuffed for his
pains‚ and is left outside to recount his grievances to the audience.

This is the scene taken from the Synapothnescontes of Diphilus,
mentioned in the Prologue, 6—11. The ‘ contamination’ accounts for
certain discrepancies of detail, e. g. Demea, v, 93, spoke os the outrage
as already of public notoriety, whereas here it is represented as having

’ only just occurred, Again, in 355-6‚ Demea has heard that 'Ctesipho

had a hand in the abduction of the girl, but there is no hint of this else-
where: indeed, the contrary is distinctly implied by Ctesipho himself in
Act ΙΙ. Sc. 3. '

Moreover, in the original the music-girl probably proved to be an
Athenian citizen, as she is called by Aeschinus in 1943 and this would
explain the open violence of his proceedings. For had Sannio detained
as a slave a free-born Athenian, he would be liable to severe penaltieS,
and Aeschinus might without risk attempt to drag him forcibly before
the courts. Otherwise he would scarcely have turned Sannio out of his
house, and maltreated him in the public street (198). But that Terence
did not intend to represent the girl as free-born is plain from the fact
that so important a point is never again alluded to, either by Sannio in
his soliloquy or by Syrus in the following scene.

155. Notice the change to trochaic metne, expressive of strong excite-
ment.

156. nunciam, ⁸ now at once ς ’ perhaps from nunc iam,

ilico (in-loco) is occasionally used in early Latin in its original
sense os place, not as later of time, cf. Phor. 88 exadvorsum ilico tonstrina
erat. There is no other certain instance in Terence, as both here and
Phor. 195 ilico could be taken either way3 but see Pl. Bacch. 1140 ilico
ambae manete,

lu'o, i. e. before Micio's door.

157. hic, ἰ. e. Sanni0.

158. istam, sc. tangam.

159. non committet· . . . vapulet, ‘he will not expose himself to a
second thrashing to-day.’ Cf. Pl. Trin. 704.

160. meorum morum, ⁸ of my character? Note the alliteration and
assonance. Cf. 1 and 57 notes. Meorum and fuisse are dissyllabic by
symzes1s.

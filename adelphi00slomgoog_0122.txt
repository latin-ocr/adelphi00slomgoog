· ”’84 . ADELPHJ. '

263. meum amorem, the reading of all MSS., has been altered to
laborem by many editors on account of the mette. Ι have preferred
Bentley's emendation of sese for se.

264. nil potent supra, sc. esse vel dici.

foris, not elsewhere in Terence in the singular. Folding doors
were in general use among the Greeks and Romans, hence the pl. fhres‚
valvae = ⁴ a door,’ though rarely, as here, foris is found, meaning strictly

' one valve of the door.

crepuit. The ancientS‚ cf. Plutarch, Poplic. 20, and early corn·
mentators thought that Greek doors opened outwards and that it was
usual for persons coming out to rattle at the doors as a warning to those
without. Most modern scholars reject this view and explain crepare,
concrepare, Gr. ψοφεῖν, of the creaking of the door on its pivots as it
opened inwardS. The ancient opinion, however, is supported by 788 of
this play, Most. 2. 2. 74, 75, and the Aristotelian Ath. Pol. c. 50. A
person knocking, is said pellere, pultare, pulsare, rarely percutere, Gr.
κόπτειν, κρούειν, ἀράσσειν. Cf. 633, 637-8.

Aer 11. SCENE 4.

Aeschinus comes out to see how affairs are progressing. Ctesipho is
very anxious to hush the matter up, and Sannio being willing to come
to terms has to be content with a promise of the eost-price.

265. me quaerit. Sannio, with comical readiness, appropriates to
himself the epithet sacrilegus.

266. quid fit? ‘how goes it?’ a common form of salutation‚ like
quid agitur. Cf. 373, 883, 901.

267. in tuto, etc. Cf. Andr. 845 omnis res est iam in vado.

omitte vero, ‘ do lay aside.‘

antidana-tristitiam. Both here and 3 58 nequitiem A alone has
preserved the archaic form, though in both places a recent corrector
has written a above the e. There is no certain instance of tristities else·
where. Cf. mollities, mundities, luxuries, segnitia, durities (Speng.).

268. hercle vero. Cf. 224. hercle commonly used by men, ecastor
by women.

qui quidem, like quippe qui, Gr. ὅς '‘ye, ‘ seeing that Ι have ; ’
269. germane, ‘ my own brother.’ Cf. 957.
in os. Cf. Fr. au nez, Gr. κατὰ στόμα.

27ο. adsentandi, snb. causa ε cf. Liv. 9. 45 pacis petendae. This con-
struction is probably due to a literal translation from the Greek of the inf. x,
with τοῦ, e. g. τοῦ κολακεύειν. The writers of the silver age often employ it.

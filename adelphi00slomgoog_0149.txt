Aci· IV. Scmm 10. [Ac‘r V. SCENE 3.]

Micio encounters Demea half frantie at the discovery that it is
Ctesipho who is in love with the music-girl. Micio with great difficulty
calms him down, and extracts an ungracious consent to be present at the
marriage ceremonies of Aeschinus and Pamphila.

quisnam. cf. 168 note.
a mo, ‘at my house.' Cf. Andr. 226 sed llIysis ab ea egreditur. ·
pepulit, rarely used of a person coming out. Cf. 264 note.

789. quid faciam Ρ quid agam P These expressions are not quite
synonymouz: quidsaciam ἓ ‘what act am Ι to do ’θ’ quid agam? ‘what

latter includes the mental conception.

connect with id nunc clamat.

792. paratae lites, ‘we are in for a row? Cf. Phor. 133 mihi
paratae lites. Ctesipho would naturally be the principal object of
Demea’s rage, though Micio and Aeschinus would come in for their ·
share.

fit sedulo, ‘I spere no painsss

418. istaec res est, ‘ that's the way.'

421. cautio eet ==cavena¹um est. In Plautus these νει-1121 substantives
retain the govemment of the original verb, e. g. Poen. 5. 5. 29 quid tibi
hanc dzgito tactio est ,· in Terence they are usually followed by a genitive
or 2 separate clause, as here; cf. Andr. 400, Phor. 293: but the dat. is
found in Andr. 44 exprobratio est inmemori benefici. Notice through-
out the whole of this speech the admirable parody of Demea’s recent
words, 2 parody which on the stage would extend to his tones and
gestures,

422. tam flagitium est quam . . . , ‘is 2 crime as heinous as . . .

423. quod queo, ‘as far as Ι oan.' Cf. 296 note.

425. hoc lautum est parum, ‘this is not washed clean enough.’
The use of lautus in its literal sense is rare. See, however, Pl. Pseud.
162-3 facite ut ffndam parata, Versa, sparsa, tersa, strata, lauta,
structaque omnia ut sint. Notice that even the sound of Demea's ‘ hoc
laudi est ’ is parodied.

viderit. The future perfect is thus used to put off or abandon
the question in point. Here, as in Andr. 892 viceris, it implies indig-
nant concession. Cf. Verg. A. 10. 743 Nunc morere, · ast de me divom
pater atque hommum rex Viderit. In such cases it is a virtual impera-
tive. Cf. Roby‚ 5667. Translate, ‘let my brother himself see to the
sellow, since so he wishes it!
439. tribulis noster, ‘of our tribe? Gr. ὁμόφυλος 01 φυλέτης.
si satis cerno, ‘unless my eyes deceive me.’
vahl is here expressive of admiration, as in Andr. 589.

ROMAN COMEDY AND TERENCE. xi

theatrioals; but when translations from Greek dramas had
monopolised the Roman stage, the Atellan farce was adopted
as an after-piem, like the Satyric drama among the GreekS, and
was regularly performed by professional actorS. The name
Atellanae, from Atella, an Oscan town near Capua, gave rise to
the erroneous supposition that these farces were performed at
Rome in the Oscan dialect 3 whereas it was only in accordance
with Roman custom to give to dramatic performances a local

freedmen and slaveS, who did not dare to represent Roman life,
or introduce Roman topicS. Even the rustic raillery and
amateur farces of early Rome had to lay their scene in Tuscan
Fescennia or Oscan Atella.

Contaot with Greek civilisation. Moreover‚ in addition
to a national deficiency of literary instinct, and ignominious
legal penalties, a third cause had operated powerfully in check-
ing any development of dramatic originality. For neen‘sy five
centuries the Romans had been engaged in a varying, yet 'almost
ceaseless struggle for supremacy, or even for existence. The

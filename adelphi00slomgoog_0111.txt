NOTES. LJNES 81-127. 7 3

100. quorsum istuc? sc. pertinet aut dicis (Don.), ‘what do you
mean by that θ’

101. flagitium, a much stronger word than peccatum, ‘ there is
nothing shameful.'

104. siit=sivit‚ on the authority of A. The contracted perf. is
found several times in PlautuS, e. g. Trin. 520-1 ne tu illunc agrum
Tuom siris umquam fieri, Mil. Gl. 1072 sisti.

106. esset . . . fieret· . . . faceremus. This use of the imperf. subj.
for the pluperf. subj. is an idiom often found in the best authors; some-
times even the pres. subj. is substituted for an imperf. or pluperf. Cf.
Madvig, Lat. Gr. 5 347, obs. 1-—33 infra 178.

fieret. The first syllable offieri,fierem,⁴etc. is usually long in
Plautus and Terence. Cf. 27 note.

107. si esses homo, ‘if you had the feelings of a man.’ Cf. 734,
736, 9343 also 579 for a different shade of meaning.

109. ubi te . . . foras, ‘ after tumbling you out of doors, a corpse
long waited for ; ’ eicere is a brutal substitute for ffrre. The phrase
purposely suggests more than it expresses. Cf. 874.

forae, an acc. pl. of the obsoletefhm, used as an adverb meaning
‘ motion out of doors ;' so foris, abl. pL, means ‘ rest out of doors?
110. alieniore, ‘less suitable.’
tamen, ⁸ after all! For its position cf. 174, 226.

111. tu homo. Homo is thus added colloquially, like ‘ fellow’ in
English, for greater emphasis: elg. 259.

116. ini, ‘therein,’ archaic form of illic, often found in PlautuS,
sometimes in Terence, and perhaps in Vergil G. 1. 54, 251, 3. 17. Cf.
577, 844. illi might, however, be here considered as a dative.

117. de meo, sc. patrimonio, ‘the expense is mine.’ Cf. 940, Pl.
Trin. 328.

1²3· οόᾱό. This archaic imperative is used by Cicero. The plural

, form cette is only found in old Latin. Cf. 688.

124. hei, interjecfion, also written ei.

¹²7· consulis. So BCDFGPV, E consilis, A consiliis. The read·
ing in the text seems to have been the only one known to Donatus; it is in·
trinsieally preferable, and the mistake of copying consiliis from the line
before so probable‚ that we have followed Fleckeisen, Wagner, and
Plessis 111 printing consulis. For the assonance cf. 57 note.

si pergis,ab10ro, ‘if you are going on so, I will be off? A future

perfect is often used by Plautus and Terence to express a future action to be
quickly and certainly performed, where in English we should employ a
future simple. Cf. 209, 538, 819, 845. On the quantity of abfero see
27 note. Cf. Madvig, ς 340, obs. 4.

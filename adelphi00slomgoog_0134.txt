archaic Latin, which reappeared in the silver age. In Terence three
consti-‚actions are found after decet:

(1) The dative, as here and 928.

(2) The acc. and inf.. infra 506, 948, 954-5.

(3) The acc. alone, as in Augustan Latin, probably by ellipse of
an inf, e. g. Andr. 421facis ut te decet (se. facere), ib. 445.

493. summa vi, ‘with all my might,’ as in 490 vis here refers to
legal proceedingS, not, as is usual, to physical force.

inum. Cf. 457 note.

495. educti. Cf. 48 note. All MSS. read educati.

497. experiar. Cf. 350.

499. After this line the MSS. of the Calliopian recension insert from
Phor. 461 Is quod mihi de hac re dederit consilium, id sequar.

500. hoo . . . cogites, ‘ see that you keep this in mind! Cf. 808.

501. quam . . . agitis, ‘ in proportion as you fare most easily! Quam
with the superlat'ive in place of quo with the comparative is rare. It is
found once elsewhere in Terence, and may be a literal translation of
⁴ ὅσῳ . . . τοσούτῳ followed by superlatives. Many editors supply vitam
after agitis, but the familiar phrase quid agir ? ‘ how do you do ’θ’ is
quite sufficient to account for the above use. Cf. Heaut. 997 quam
maxime kuic vana haec suspicio erit, tam facillume, etc.

503. aequo animo aequa noscero, ‘ fairly to recognise what is just
and fair.'

504. si . . . probos. In Augustan Latin a predicative word following
an inf. and referring to a subject in the nom. is itself in the nom„ e. g.
Bibulus studet fieri consul. Cf. Phor. 767, Madv. 5 393.

506. decet to facere. Cf. 491 note.

507. me indicente, ‘without warning from me? The particle in
prefixed to verbs seems to have a negative sense only with participleS,
as above and Phor. 951 quod dictum indictum est, Andr. 782 iocularium
in malum insciens paene incidi, ib. 603, etc. Liv. 22. 39 etiam me
insciente.

utinam hie sit modo defunctum, ‘ 1 only pray that this may
prove the end! Cf. Phor. 1021 cupio misera in hac re iam defungier.
hio, adverb. ’

510. evomam. Cf. 312.

Aer 111. SCENE 5.
Hegio speaks a few reassuring words to Sostrata, before going in
search of Micio.

511. istam, sc. Pamphila.

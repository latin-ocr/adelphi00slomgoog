NOTES. LINES 915-949. 119

’ ineptis. Terence only uses the verb here and in Phor. 4²0·
si tu sis homo. Cf. 107 note.

935. asine. Cf. Heaut. 877 quae sunt dicta in stulta, caudex, stipes,
asi‚nus plumbeus..

937. aufer. The exact meaning of this word cannot be certainly
determined. Donatus says aufer vel te vel manum, i. e. either‘ away
with you,' or ‘hands off.⁸ The latter interpretation is dramatically
probable‚ as may be seen from the stage directions. On the other hand
aufer te is used twice by Plautus, while aufer manum is not found
elsewhere. Either te or manum is more probable than nugas} as
suggested by Lewis and Short.

da veniam, ‘grant this favour‚’ as in 942, and frequently.

939. estis auctores ==suadetis, and so is followed by an acc. as
though the phrase were really transitive. Cf. Pl. Poen. 1. 3. 1 quidnam·
mihi es auctor, M’lplzio ? supra 617.

940. promisti. Cf. 561 note.

de te is munh more forcible than de tue, seeing that Aeschinus
had been liberal enough, according to his own account, to offer Micio ·
himself to Sostrata.

94²· omittitis Cf. 128 note.

943. vis, ‘ downright violence!

age, prolixe, ‘ come, be generous) Prolixe. an adverb.

946-7. Both the readings and the distribution of the words among
the speakers are uncertain. The text keeps as closely as possible to the
MSS. In 946 confit is admitted for fit ou the authority of Donatus„ an
additional syllable being necessary for the mette. In 947 cognatus and
his est have been transposed for the same reasons. No MS. marks a
change of speaker before merito or quid nunc or Hegio. All MSS.
assign verum quid, etc. to Demea. Bentley conjectured,

DE. Merito tuo te amo ; verum—Mn Quid? DE. Ego dicam, hoc
cum fit quod volo.
M1. Quid nunc ? quid restat f DE. fflgio hic est his cognatus
proximus.
He has been followed with some variations by many editors, but the
text of the MSS. gives a very good sense. With quid nunc understand
est.
948. adfinis, sc. by the marriage of Pamphila aud Aeschinus.
nos facere decet. Cf. 491 note.
, 949. ageni paululum‘ a little bit of a farm? ‘Here and ixi 650

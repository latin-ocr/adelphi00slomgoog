righteous indignation on the head of Aeschinus. His agitation is such
that only with difficulty can Sostrata elicit an account of what has

299. quod, lit. ‘with reference to which ;' cf. 162 note. Quod appears
in Δ. Β C E F P, cum altered to quod in D, quod cum in G. Many
editors, on the analogy of Pl. Capt. 516, Rud. 664, substitute quom for
quod. But as quod gives a good sense, there seems hardly sufficient jus·
tification for this plausible emendation. Translate, ‘ matters are now
at such a pass, that if . . .’ Such a sentence as this shows us quod in a
transition state between a pronoun and a conjunction.

300. auxili. This form of the genitive from nouus in dus, dum, was
general until the latter part of the Augustan age. Vergil only uses the
form in -ii once, A. ,3. 702 fluvii, Horace never. ovid was the first to
introduce the longer form, for metrical reasons, However adjectives in
-2'us do not contract the genitive.

301. filiae erili = filiae erae. cf. Andr. 602 erilis filius.

302. circumvallant, sc. nos.

emergi. This verb is sometimes used transitively, more often in·
transitively, and so impersonally in the passive, as here. Cf. Andr. 562
spero . . . facile ex illis sese emersurum malis, Eun. 555. The mixture
of metaphors in circumvallant and emergi is perhaps intentional in the
mouth of a Thracian slave, yet cf. ‘ to take arms against a sea of
troubles!

potest, impersonal, as commonly in Terence. Cf. 350 note.

304. hocine saeelum! acc. of exclamation3 cf. 758. The particle
-ne stands here, as with the acc. and inf„ in indignant exclamations. Cf.
37 note.

305. quod. Cf. 162 note.

sio, δεικτικῶς, as often in the comic poeta.

306. mum, pleonastic after quem, for the sake of emphasis. cf. Verg.

A· 1· 1-3‚ 5· 457
Nunc dextra ingeminans ictus nunc ille sinistra.

310. vix sum compos animi, ‘ Ι am scarcely master of myself3 ⁹ not
identical with compos mentis, which means ‘ sane?

312. evomam. Cf. 510.

313. The MSS. give ⁸ satis . . . dum illos ulcis-car m0d0,’ which does
not scan. The insertion of meo seems the best emendation.

satis supplici, ‘vengeance enough! Cf. 300 note.

314. illud scelus, ‘ that villain‚' i.e. Aeschinus, Cf. Andr. 607 Ubi
illic est? scelus, qui me. . .

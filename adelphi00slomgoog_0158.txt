1 20 ADELPHI.

tion probably implies that the farm in question was so poor that no
tenant stopped on it long.

950. qui. Cf. 179 note. ‘ Let us allow him to have the use of it.'

autem. Cf. 135 note.

951. huic, i. e. Pamphila. Demea points to Sostrata's house.

95²· non=n0nne. Cf. 94 note. ‘ Do I not now appropriato that
saying which . . ’ Or non meum may be closely connected, ‘That
saying is none of mine which . . .’ This, however, makes facio difficult.

953. dixti. Cf. 561 note.

dudum, ‘just now? i. e. 833-4. Dudum can also mean ‘ some
time ag0.’ In Pl. Trin. 608 quam dudum = ‘how long ag0.’ Cf.
Phor. 459 incertior sum multo quam dudum.

954. senecta. This form is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον in Terence, b'ut is often
found in Plautus alongside of senectus. It is probably an adjective
agreeing with aetas, which is frequently expressed in the phrase senecta
aetate.

956. quid istic Ρ Cf. 133 note. ΤΙιε MSS. give istuc, but the phrase
is so common that the change is justified.

956-7. As these verses stand in the MSS. they are senarii. As 934-
9 5 5 and 958 are octonarii (iambic), some editors assume lacunae in

958. suo sibi gladio huno iugulo, ‘I hoist him with his own
petard.' Sibi throws additional emphasis on suo, ‘ his own particulam?
Cf. Cic. Phil. 2. 37. ξ 96 prius quam tu suum sibi venderes, ipse pos·
sedit. For a scene ending with a broken line see 81 note.

Ac‘r V. SCENE 6 [9].

Demea completes the discomfiture of Micio by prevailing on him to
manumit Syrus and his wife, besides advaucing them money to make a
start in life on their own account. His bewildered brother appeals to
him for an explanation, whereupon Demea, in his true character, points
the moral of the Play and the curtain falls ¹.

959. frugi homo ἐ, ‘ you are a useful fellow?
frugi is really a dativus commodi of the obsoletesmx. Practically
it is used as an indeclinable adjective, in Terence applied usually to
Slaggg: 'ghe93racler is iudico aequom esse Syrum fieri liberum.

² In Roman theatres the curtain was lowered (aulaea premere) to the
floor or perhaps drawn under the stage at the commencement of a play,
and raised again at the conclusion (aulaea tollere). Cf. Hor. Ep. 2. 1.
189 quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas, Verg. G. 3. 25
purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.

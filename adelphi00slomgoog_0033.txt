11. Retention of the quantity of final syllables originally
long. This is rare in Terence. Of the nineteen instances
quoted by Wagner, Terence Introd. 14, only two are certain,
Phor. 9 stetit, and Ad. 23 augeat. These cases tend to confirm
the opinion that -it of Perf. Ind. and —at of PreS. Subj. were
originally long, while there is more doubt with reference to the
same terminations in other tenses· Thus Ovid regularly
lengthens periit, redit-t, subiit, ete.

In Ennius and Plautus such long syllables are common, espe-
cially —or (-ωρ), -at, -et, -it. Lucretius seldom permits himself
this licence, but Vergil freely lengthens any syllable, whether
originally long or not, but only in arszls· and usually when a
pause follows. Horace lengthens —dt, -it, -ἔί, in verbs about
fifteen times·

111. Synizesis. Almost any two vowels not separated by a
consonant may be contracted into a single syllable. This is
most common in the case of pronouns, e. g. 10 e-um, 114 tzwm,
160 mffirum, 581 lzzTiz-cs, 648 271’53 also in other words, e. g. 79
nescia 160 fnisse, 225 cb‘emtlrse, 573 de‘brsum, 971 swrsum, etc.
Sometimes a word made monosyllabic by synizesis is then
elided‚ e. g. 10 e'iim, 8 54 νὲἳ. In Terence dehinc and proin are
always of one syllable, and antehac of two,

Augustan poets employ Synizesis sparingly, chiefly in making
consonantal i or u, as abiete=abybta tenuia=tenvia, or in such
cases as aar& (Verg.)‚ autiit (Ov.), quoad (Hor.).

IV. Hiatus is admitted,

(1) At a change of speaker, e. g. 604, 697, 767.

(2) At the Caes-ura or at a strong pause, e. g. 574.

(3) After an interjection, e. g. 183, 304, 336. Note, however,
that 0 may be elided‚ e. g. 407, 449.

In a monosyllable a long final vowel, or a vowel before m may
be shortened and not elided‚ e. g. 111 ml ad, 1 18 dam erit, 215
qul hodie, and in lines 232, 336, 341, 527, 618, 680, 705, 920.
This kind of hiatus is admitted eleven times by Lucretius
(Munro 2. 404 note), rarely by Augustan poets, e. g. Hor. Sat.
1. 9. 38 si ml amas, Verg. Ecl. 8. 108 an qul amant.

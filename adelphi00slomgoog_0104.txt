66 A DELPHI.

claudi, sc. servos: he composed the music for all Terence’s plays.

Sarranis. According to Servius tibiae Sarranaeztibiae pares, i. e.
two of equal size and stops: tibiae Phrygiae=tib2ae inpares, i. e. two of
unequal size and stop& Sarra was the old Latin sor Tyre. Tibiae are
also called dextrae and sinistrae. Probably dextrae were treble and
sinistrae bass, but the evidence is conflicting.

facta. sexta, i. e. sixth in order of Terence's comedieS. .

Cethegus and Gallus were consuls 160 Β. C.

· Prologue.

It had been the custom of the earlier dramatists to give a plot of the
Play in the Prologue: cf. 22. ’ As dramatic art developed this was felt
to be nnnecessary, and Terence only followed the exmple set by
Plautus in the Trinnmmus (if the Prologus of that play be anthemio), in
making the various characters of the comedy nnfold its story to the
audience. It was, however, an innovation either to write no Ptologne
at all—as at the first representation of the Hecyra, md possibly of
the Andria—or to make the Prologne a vehicle for answering per-
sonal criticisms and attacking eritics. The Prologues of the six plays
of Terence are all genuine, while the twelve extant prologues of
Plautus are all spurious, with the possible exception of that to the
Trinnmmns. '

1. postquam=quoniam (Donat.)= contrast quoniamaquom iam
Plant. Aul. Prol. 9, the fact being that the ideas of sequence in time
and of causality fade imperceptibly into each other.

poeta. Terence never introduces his own name, as Plautus some-
times does.

scriptura. in Terence means (a) ‘the work composed;’ ef. Hec.
Prol. 2. 13 ne cum poeta scriptura evanesceret ; ib. 24.

(β) ‘ The style of the composition ;’ cf. Phor. Ptol. 5 fabulas tenui esse
oratione et scriptura levi. The former sense is here preferable.

Notioe the double alliteration‚ which' however Terence does not nse
to the same extent as Plautus, though examples are frequent in his pro-
logues. Cf. 3, 7, 11, 13, 19, 21. Jordan calculates that an alliteration
occurs in about every 9 lines of Plautus and 2ο lines of Terence.

2. iniquis, sc. Luscius Lanuvinus and his party; cf. Andr. 7, Phor. 1
and 13, Heaut. 22.

observari=captari (Donat.), ‘ criticised.’

3. rapere in peiorem partem, ‘ pick to pieoes!

quam, sc. fabulam, implied in scripturam.

tence, at once interjectional and interrogative, is well shown here. Cf.
38 note.

331. nostram vitam omnium. So all MSS.; we should have
expected nostrum gen. pl.

332. unum numquam. Cf. 293· Some editors suppress erant and
scau this line and the next as trochaic septenarii.

333. patris, i. e. the adopted father Micio. By receiving the infant
in his arms Micio would sanction the marriage.

335. ae potius . . . prospice, ‘ and rather consider what course should
be adopted in the future.’

quod ad hane rem opus est. The constructions of opus 'and
usus are,

(1) Personal, with the thing needed in the nom. as a subject.
The phrase may be completed by ad with an acc„ as here and Andr.
740, or by an ablative which is sometimes a perf. part. pass. as in 996
quid facto opus est, more rarely a supine as in 740. Roby, ξ 507,
suggests that this may be a combination of quid est opus and quofacto
est opus. Cf. 429, 625. ’

(2) Impersonal, with the thing needed in the abL, which may be
a noun, adjective, or participle, very rarelyin the gen. (twice in Livy)
or acc. (twice in Plautus). In place of an abl. an infinitive, or acc.
and infinitive, is sometimes found 3 e. g. 625, and the person needing is
always in the dat. Cf. 342, 601.

Notice the alliteration.

339. proferimus. Note the present instead of the future, as often

in Terence, rarely in Augustan writers. Cf. Zumpt, ξ 510.

infitias ibit, ‘ he will deny it,' viz. his relations with Pamphila.

sat· seio, parenthetical. Cf. 79 note.

340. si maxume fateatur, ‘ if he should confess it ever so much.‘

342· tacito est opus. Cf. 335 note. Both tacere and silere are
sometimes transitive.

minume gentium, ‘ not sor the world! ' gentium is a partitive
genitive after minume. Cf. nusquam gentium, ποῦ γῆςς etc. 540.

343. Sostrata. Terence usually preserves the long termination of

Greek names in -a, except of dissyllableS, as Geta.
agis, the reading of A. ; cf. 195 note : other MSS. agas.

344. potis est, ‘is possible.’ Petis may refer to a subject of any
gender‚ or may be used impersonally. The neut. pote is similarly
employed, but usually without est, while with potis the est is nearly
always expressed. Potz's rarely refers to a plural subject, and neither
potis nor pote is found in classical prose. Cf. 521, 626.

122 ADELPHI.

986. qnod . . . putant. This clause is explanatory of id. Translate,
‘your reputation with your nephews for good-nature and good-fellowship.‘
987. ox vera vita, ‘from integrity of lise? This sense of verus is
not rare; cf. Andr. 629 ab! id est verum? Cic Leg. 2. 5. 11 quod
est rectum verum quoque est.
adeo. cf. 629 note, 989.

989. vobis . . . Aeschine. Cf. Verg. A. 1. 140 vestras, Eure, domos,
9. 525 Vos, O Calliope. . . . The figure by which all are understood
though only one is mentioned is called Synecdoche, Roby, ξ 950.

990. iusta iniusta, adverbial acc„ vobis being understood aster

obsequor. Translate, ‘because I do not humour you in absolutely ·

everything in every way, right or wrong!

991. missa facio, ‘ I wash my hands of it? Cf. 906 note.

992-5. Translate, ⁸ but if in those things wherein youth makes you
short-sighted‚ over-eager‚ and thoughtless„ you rather choose to have
reproof, correction, and indulgence at the proper times, here am 1 at
your service)

The MSS. insert me after corrigere. This is almost certainly a gloss,
as it not only spoils the mette, but also the climax ecce me. The
infinitives reprehendere, etc„ grammatically require an acc. aliquem
to be understood before them; but this was perhaps intentionally omitted
in order to make the expression as impersonal as possible.

obsecundare in loeo. Cf. 216 note. Heaut. 827.

996. quid. facto opus est. Cf. 195, 335 notes.

997. habeat, sc. psaltriam.

Cantor. In all Terence’s plays ω is inserted before the final
plaudite. In some MSS. the actors are designated by A, B, etc. in the
order of their appearance on the stage, and ω would therefore naturally
indicate the last speaker. It is probable that this speaker was not one
of the dramatis personae. Horace calls him Cantor, A. P. 155 ε

Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis, et usque

Sessuri donec Cantor ‘vos plaudite ’ dicat.
Very likely the Cantor was the performer introduced by Livius Andro-
nicus, Liv. 7. 2, who sang the lyrical cantica.

Bentley conjectured ω to be a corruption of CA=Cantor, but the
above theory is more plausible. It is to be noted however that Cic. pro
Sest. 55, ς 118 uses cantores asa-hesm‘ones.

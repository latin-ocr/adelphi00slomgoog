841. oum primo luci. In old Latin luce, fuci, and Iucu are all found
as ablatives or locatives of lux, which before the Augustan period was
eithermaseuline or feminine.

de noete, ‘ by night : ’ de indicating the time from which the
action dates. CL 965 de die.

843. pugnaveris, a colloquial expression explained by Donatus as
magnam rem ficen's. ‘ You’ll have won the day! Cf. Pl. Epid. 3. 4.
57 homo es, pugnavisti. The fut. perf. accurately expresses the result
which follows the fut. simple abstrahant.

845. videro. Cf. 127 note.

846-7. The order is Atque ibifaxo (ut) sit coquendo et molendo plena

853. ego sentio, ‘I have some feelingsss

854. Notice that I is elided, and that rei in both cases is made mono·

Metres xxviii, xxix.

Ac‘r V. SCENE 1 [4].

Demea reflects on the practical results of his own and his brother’s
manner of life. He sees that it is pleasanter to be affable and liberal
than morose and arsimonious‚ and resolves to turn over a new leaf.
But if he has erret!2 in being too stem, so has Micio in being too com-
plaisant. Therefore Demea undertakes a practical demonstration of his
brother’s failings by an extravagant travesty of his easy-going principles.

855. The assumption by Demea of a lighter character is reflected in

the metre by the change from iambics to trochaics.

numquam . . ., ete. ‘ No one has -ever had a rule of life so well
tho ht out.’

tlgrcubdumza, lit. ‘ calculated.' Subducere rationem =to cast up an

account by subtracting the debit from the credit total. Cf. Pl. Capt. 192
subducam ratiunculam: often in Cicero.

ita qualifies the whole sentence, not merely bene, as then tam
would have been used.

857. ut. ‚nesciam ‘so that you find yourself ignorant of.’ This
clause expresses the general result of the teaehings of experience as set
forth in 85 5-7, and does not depend immediately on moneat, which, 1n
the sense of ‘ warning that you do not know,’ would of course be fol-
lowed by an infinitive, not by ut with a subjunctive.

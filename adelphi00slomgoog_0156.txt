iube . . . dinumeret. Both Plautus and Terence sometimes con-
struct iubere with the subjunctive. e. g. Eun. 691, Heaut. 737.
ille Babylo, i. e. Micio, The luxury and extravagance of Baby-
lonians seem to have been proverbial, and Demea gives his brother this
nick-name on account of his prodigality. Twenty minae had been the
sum already paid by Micio for the music-girl (cf. 191, 369)3 Demea
now, with mischievous glee, bids him disburse the like amount for the
expenses of the wedding. Babylo is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Some have thought
Babylo to be a steward of Micio or Demea; but the presence of ille
puts this out of the question. Cf. Heaut. 452 Satrapa si siet amator.

Micio has found Syrus pulling down the garden·wall‚ by Demea’s
order, as the slave alleges. In utter astonishment hc comes out to
discover what it all means. Demea at once shows how enlarged his
views have become. He insists that his bachelor brother must marry
Sostrata and reward Hegio by the present of a nice little farm, and,
backed up by Aeschinus, actually extorts a reluctant consent from the
bewildered Micio.

925. ego vero iubeo ε καὶ δὴ κελεύω, ‘ Yes, Ι do order it.’

928. nobis decet. Cf. 491 note.

931. parere . . . non potest. Demea would not have urged the
match, had there been any chance of children to inherit Micio's property
instead of Aeschinus.

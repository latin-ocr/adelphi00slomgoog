xxiv IN TROD UCTION.

Act V. Experience, though late, has taught Demea that his
system of education is as unsuccesssul as his brother’s‚ while his
churlish and parsimonious habits gain him nothing but enemieS.
He resolves therefore to correct his own mistakes‚ and to teach
Micio how far he has erred in the opposite extreme. The
monologue in Scene 1 is spoken in the fictitious character which
heis about to play in furtherance of this object.· He at once
proceeds to outbid Micio in courtesy and complaisance. He
flatters Syrus (Sc. 2), and Geta (Se. 3) 3 he orders (Sc. 4) the
marriage of Aeschinus to be ratified immediately, and the par-
tition wall 'between the gardens of Micio and Sostrata to be
pulled down. With the aid of Aeschinus (Se. 5) he forces from
the astonished Micio a reluctant consent to marry Sostrata, to
present Hegio with a farm, and to set free Syrus with his wife t
he even sanctions the alliance of Ctesipho with the music-girl.
He is naturally greeted with a chorus of effusive flattery3
whereupon‚ dropping the part which he had been playing,
he shows Micio how cheap is the popularity gained by indis-
criminate indulgence, and closes the play with some sensible
advice to the young men.

The verdict of posterity on the Adelphi is shown by the
number of modern plays wholly or partly based upon it.
Garrick's Guardzan, Baron’ s Ecole des Peras, and F agan s La
Pupzlle are direct adaptations.

Micio and Demea are the originals of leading characters m
Cumberland’ s Cholerzc Man, Shadwell’ s Squtre ofAlsatza‚ and ⁴
Diderot' s La Pbre de ,QFamzlle and the greatest of F rench Come-
dians is under no inconsiderable obligations to the same source
in his Ecole des Maris. <

On the stage the Andria may be equally effective, but from a
literary point of view the Adelphi is beyond question the master- ·
piece of Terence.

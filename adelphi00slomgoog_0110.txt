72 ' ADELPHL

81. Plautus never begins a scene with a broken line, as Terence does
here and elsewhere, e. g. 635, 958.

quaerito, ‘ 1 am trying to find.’ Note the force of the frequentative
verb. Cf. 321, 363.

82-3. ubi nobis Aeschinus niet, ‘ since we have an Aeschinus.’
For ubi in this sense and construction cf. Pl. Amph. 439 ubi ego Sosia
esse nolim, tu esto sane Sosia. The text gives the reading of all MSS.
Many editors adopt Ritschl's conjecture:

DE. Rogas me 3² ubi nobis Aeschinust?
Scin iam quid tris-tis ego sim ?

siet, archaic for sit. Terence uses siem3 e1g. 712, sies, e.g. 684,
852, 890, siet, e.g. 282, 298, 611, 976, sient3 alsopossiem 877, adsiet 619.

dixin hoe fore Ρ ‘did I not say this would be so? Some
editos, against the MSS„ give these words to Demea.

-ne =nonne, as often in Terence and Plautus. Indeed, it is
doubtful whether nonne was found in the original MSS. of these writers,
-ne or non being used indifferently. Cf. 94 note, 727, Cic. Pro Mil.
ς 38, etc.

84. quid ille fecerit Ρ The subj. depends on the ellipse of rogas, or
some similar word. It is common in an indignant or excited repetition
of a question asked by another, e. g. 261, 374.

pudet, occasionally personal in Plautus and Terence, the subject
being usually a pronoun. Cf. 754.

86. antehac. See Introduction on Prosody xxix.

87. modo quid dier-signavit Ρ ‘what’s his last exploit?’ mod0=‘ just
now.’ disszjgnare is probably a different word from deszgnare. Cf. Hor.
Ep. 1. 5. 16.

89. familiam, i. e. the slaves. Cf. 297 note.

90. usque ad mortem, ‘ almost to death. ’ Notice this sense of
usque ad, ‘right up to, but just stopping short of? Cf. Andr. 199.

92. quot. All MSS. here read quod, but Δ. regularly gives quod and
aliquod for quot and alzquot.

94. non= nonne. Cf. 83 note, 727, 754, 781, 942, 952.

95. rei dare operam, ‘looking after the property.’ The infinitive
construction after videre, in place of a participle, is not common.

96. huius, gen. nent.. sc. this conduct of Aeschinus (cf. 92 hoc), de-
pendent on simile, which always governs a gen. in Plautus and Terence.
Cf. 411. It is possible, however, to understand leuius of Ctesipho as a
gen. afterfactum.

illi, dat. incommodi.
98. inperito, ‘with no experience of life?
numquam, used as an emphatic negative: cf. 528, 551, etc.

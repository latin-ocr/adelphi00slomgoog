xvi INTROD UCTION.

belief was‚that he died at Stymphalus, in Arcadia, from grief on
hearing of the loss of his MSS„ which he had sent on before
him by sea. Porcius Licinus narrates that his noble patrons
suffered him to die in such abject poverty that he had not even
a lodging at Rome whither a slave might have brought news of
his death. This is probably untrue, for Suetonius writes that he
left gardens of twenty jugera in extent on the Appian Way, and

his prologueS. These indicate a lack of independence and.

Between such plays and the polished productioris of Terence
there is a world of difference. Terence sought the approbation,
not of the uncultured masseS, but of a select circle of literary
men. His highest aim was to produce in the purest Latin a
perfect representation of the comedies of Menander and his
school. His cardinal virtueS, as a writer, were correctness of
language and consistency of character. His scene is always
laid at AthenS, ancl rarely in his six plays is to be found an

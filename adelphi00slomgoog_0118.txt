80 A DE LPHI.

and begs Syrus to use his good offices to obtain sor him the cost· ·price of

209. conveniam ipsum. A gives οοΝνΕΝῐΑΜῙΑΜῐΡευΜ.

This insertion of iam is a good instance of dittography, Le. a
repetition through an error of the copyist of the same or similar letters,
a fruitful source of corruption in MSS. Thus many MSS. insert iam
after accepiat in this line, which is almost certainly a mistake of the
same character. ·

faxo· Plautus and Terence use the following, faxo (ind.), faxim
(subj.)‚ saxis, faxit (ind. or subj.), faximus (subj.)‚ faxitzlr (ind. or
subj.), faxint (subj.)‚ Two views are held with regard to these forms:

(1) They may be syncopated forms for fecero, fecerim, etc: cf.
Zumpt, ξ 161.

(2) They may be arch-aie futures, formed exactly like the Greek by
adding -so to the verb-stem, e. g. sac-so =fc1x0 as πραγ-σω--πράξωε the
tense in -sz‘m being the subjunctive ι cf. Roby, §5 291—3, Madv. ξ 115 f.

This philological uncertainty is not removed by the practical
usage of the forms in question. In the present passage it is quite an
open question (cf. 1 27 note), butfaxo is often used where a fut. simple
would naturally stand, and in 847—8 it is a direct coordinate offuciam,
fut. The subjunctive form is never used as a peril, but always as
a fut. subj„ · cf. the common phrase di faxint expressive of a wish‚
Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 38 cave faxzsss and the use of auszssm Vergil, Livy,
Ovid, and Horace occasionally employ these formS, and di saxmt is
found even in Cicero. As regards construction faxo is followed four times
in Terence by the fut. ind.; cf. Phor. 308 zamfaxo hic aderit, ib. 1055,
Eun. 285, 663, thr ice by the pres. subj. here and infra 847 placed after the
subj., and Andr. 854. It is also constructed with an acc. and a perf.
f part. pass, e. g. Heaut. 341 ademptum tibi iam faxo omnem metum.
There is no certain instance of the fut. ind. after saxo in Plautus, and
the Augustan writers always use the subjunctive construction.

Translatest ,that you have had some little fighting· match with
my aster. SA. I never saw a fight worse matched.’

nescio quid.. Cf. 79 note.

214. tua eulpa. Ablative: cf. Hec. 228.
morem gestum oportuit, sc. morem a te gestum esse oportuit,
‘ you ought to have humoured.’ Cf. 218, 431, 672, 708, Andr. 641, etc.
The acc. and inf. is the regular construction after oportet in Terence, e. g.
Heaut. 536 haecfacta ab illo oportebat, esse being omitted with a perf..
inf. pass, Cf. Andr. 239.

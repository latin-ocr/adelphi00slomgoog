norimus==n0verimus. The ancient long quantity is found else-
where in Plautus and Terence, e. g. Phor. 772, also in ovid.

272. The text gives the reading of all the MSS. The phrase res rediit
is so common, e. g. Phor. 153, 359, 686, etc„ that many editors have
suppressed one paene and introduced rem, alteriug scisse to rescisse. But
redirc= ‘ to be reduced to’ is used with a personal subject, e.g. Caes.
Β· G· 3· 93, ib. 5. 483 and there seems scarcely sufficient ground for so
considerable an alteration of the MSS„ especially as the sentence is a
mene continuation of nos paene sero scisse.

not to commit himself.

proporat. Cf. 128 note.

ne tam quidem l with a gesture, δεικτικῶς. Cf. 163, 422. ‘ Not
even so much‚’ i.e. not at all. This demonstrative use of tam seems
colloquial, being almost confined to the comedians and Cicero’s Letters.
See Lewis and S. ii. B. 3. Dziatzko reads non tam quidem, quam vis ;
etiam maneo otiosus hic.

. 279. ne time. This archaic construction is not common in Terence, and

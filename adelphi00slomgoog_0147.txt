cantites. This passage seems to allude to Roman customs and
feeling rather than Greek. At Athens music and dancing were a regular
part of education, and were commonly practised in every-day life. At
Rome such frivolities were left to slaves, to be performed for the amuse-
ment of their masters. So strong was the Roman prejudice against
dancing, except in certain religious ceremonies, that Cicero (pro Mur. 6)
writes, nemo fire saltat sobrius, nzlri fhrte insanit. Demea’s sneers‚
therefore, would have fallen rather flat upon a Greek audience, but such
conduct in the head of a Roman house would have been considered an
indeceut outrage of propriety; and when even this taunt fails to touch
Micio‘s sense of shame, we can well understand Demea, in his utter
despair and disgust, really thinking his brother to be out of his right
mind. Cf. 761 senex delirans. On the above supposition, we have
here perhaps the most distinctly Roman allusion in any of Terence's

752. restim ductans. A rope-dance is mentioned by Livy 27. 35.
§¹ 14 in fhro pompa constitit .· per manus reste data virgines sonum vocis

761. Salus, daughter of Aesculapius, Abstraction and personification
were the special characteristics of Roman religion. In other words, the
Romans personified qualitieS, natural phenomena, etc., and then wor-
shipped· them as gods. See Mommsen, vol. i. c. xii.

Demea’s anger and disgust are still further increased by the insolence
of Syrus, who comes out of the house more than half drunk.

At this point in the MSS. begins Act V,—a dramatic impossibility.
Some division of a play into Acts was known to Terence, cf. Hec.
Prol. 31 primo actu placeo, and is referred to by Horace, Cicero, etc. ι
but the existing arrangement was the work of later editors, and in
this case was made with manifest reference to an equal division of the
'remaining lines between Acts 1V and V, the action of the play being

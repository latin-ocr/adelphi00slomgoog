moral at all, though many such readers have been rather puzzled
by the apparent change of Demea’s character in Act V.

Terence takes two opposite theories of education of which
’ Micio and Demea are respectively the representatives.

Micio was an easy-going city bachelor who had adopted
Aeschinus, the elder of his brother Demea’s two sons· He
liked to enjoy life in his own way, and was willing to allow other
people a similar license. In accordance with these principles

he gave to Aeschinus the fullest liberty of action. The young ¹

man was free to do what he liked, go where he pleased, and
draw money without stint. Micio disbelieved in education
by sear, and thought that by such means he would gain the
confidence and love of his adopted son3 and that even if
Aeschinus did sow his wild oats somewhat recklessly no per-
manent harm would be done. The result sadly disappointed
his expectations. He had endeavoured to inculcate one thing
above all others, that Aeschinus should be perfectly frank and
open, concealing nothing and disguising nothing (52-8). Yet
Micio first hears of the abduction of the music· girl from Demea,
when all the town was already talking of it (93). A'nd still
worse, for nine months Aeschinus had been paying daily visits
to Pamphila in the very next house (293), carefully keeping
Micio in ignorance of the whole affair (64o); nor does his
honour, on which his uncle placed such reliance, prevent him
from telling a direct lie (641) under sear of discovery. Micio's
theory, therefore, of unlimited indulgence proves a complete
failure: the opposite system of strict repression we shall find
equally unsuccessful.

Demea is an old-fashioned country gentleman, thrifty in his .

manner of life, violent in temper, uncompromising in opinion.
He has brought up his younger son, Ctesipho, under the most

rigid discipline. He flatters himselfthat nothing goes on without j

his knowledge (396, 546-8), and that his son is a really steady
young man, who is entirely innocent of his brother’s wicked

ways (94-6). Yet, in spite of all this careful training and ¹

supervision, Ctesipho becomes deeply involved in an intrigue

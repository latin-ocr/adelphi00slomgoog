(d) Iambic Dimeter Aeatalectic‚ or quaternarius. (3.)
(e) Iambio Dimeter catalectic. (1 3 in 612 b.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi3 but the
spondee, tribrach‚ anapaest‚ and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must be an iambus, unles5‚ of course, the
verse is catalecticz Moreover, as the Tetrameter is Asynartete‚
i. e. regarded as being composed of two verseS, with the division
after the fourth foot, that foot is usually an iambus3 and such
words as ege, tibi, cede, are allowed to stand there as ‘if at
the end of a senarius. In any Iambic metre an anapaest is
occasionally resolved into a Proceleusmatic (υυυυ), which is
most commonly in the first foot and composed of two distinct
pairs of syllables. Cf. 35, 118, 192, 254, 264, 459, 476, 827,

(a) Trochaic 'I'etrameter Aeatalectie, or octonarius, (18.)
(b) Trochaic 'I'etrameter catalectici, or Septenarius. (201.)
(c) Trochaic Dimeter Catalectio. (4.)

These lines consist¹ in their pure form of trochees; the
spondee, tribrach‚ anapaest, and dactyl are also admitted. But
only the trochee‚ tribrach‚ and sometimes dactyl are found in
the seventh foot of the Septenarius. Trochaic, like Iambic
TetrameterS‚ are considered to be divided after the fourth
foot. As the Trochaic metre is more quick and lively than
the Iambic‚ it is naturally employed in scenes where feeling
'and excitement are represented.

Besides the above, 613 seems to be ChoriambiC, composed of
3 choriambi (- υ υ -) ; and 610a is an irregular line, apparently
made up of one iambic dipodia with a syllable over. But the
metres in the short Canticum διο-7 are very uncertain.

Prosody. The rules of prosody, as commonly taught, must
be considerably modified‚ if we are to understand the scansion
of Plautus and Terence. It must always be remembered that
the poets of the late days of the Republic and their successors
were writing in a literary language, not in the language of every-

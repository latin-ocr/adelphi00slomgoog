NOTES. LJNES 2 34—262. 83

259. The meaning is, ‘that no human being has a brother more
eminently endowed with the highest qualities?

homini nemini. Cf. 111 note, Phor. 591, etc.

For artes= ‘ qualities' cf. Andr. 3 3.

primarum artium principem. Perhaps no phrase exactly parallel
can be adduced; though Liv. 8. 21 princip& sententiarum consulares
is similar.

260. ellum=ecce illum. The fuller forms eccillum, eccillam, eccillud
are used by PlautuS‚ e. g. Trin. 622. Ecce is also compounded with cases
of is and iste, e. g. eccum (common), eccam, eccos, eccas, ecca, eccistam.
Sometimes eccum is followed by another accusative. Cf. 389, 553, 720,
890, 923.

hem is here an exclamation of joy, more commonly of surprise,
grief, alarm, anger, etc.

Spengel scans Aeschinus Ι ubi‘st illum, on the ground that the last
syllable of the fourth foot of an iambic tetrameter is regarded aa at the
end of a verse. It is to be observed, however, that Terence frequently
does not end a word with the fourth foot, e. g. in three of the six pre-
ceding lineS. So that it is doubtful whether Spengel's scansion is more
likely than Aes l chlnds 22} bist lllum. See Introduction on MetreS.
Cf. Andr. 957.

261. qmd sit Ρ Cf. 84 note.

festivom caput-l ‘delightful fellow!' Cf. Andr. 371 ridiculum
caput, infra 983, 986. Itis a translation of Gr. κάρα, similarly used.

262. The text gives what was probably the original reading of Δ.
(except that putavit is printed for putarit), but the line has been mate-
rially altered by a later hand. Most other MSS. read qui omnia sibi
post putarit. Most editors adopt quin omnia, etc., the only reading
known to DonatuS‚ explaining quin as quine. But in all the passages
quoted by them where -ue is affixed to the relative, e. g. Andr. 768,
Phor. 923, Pl. Rud. 272, ib. 538, there is a question 3 here there is not.
It seems therefore most simple to take quin as a corroborative particle,
⁶ indeed, · ’ in which case the asyndeton between this and the following
clause⁶ 15 emphatic and natural.

Note the following uses of quin.

(1)‘ Why not ’θ’ either· 111 direct or indirect questions.

(2) With imperative& This use was a natural development of the
first· , for quin taces 7 is equivalent⁶ 111 sense to a command: e. g. 533, 543.

(3) In the common sense, ‘ but that,' after verbs expressing doubt,
prevention, and the like, with a negative: e. g. 257, 294.
, (4) As a corroborative particle, ‘ indeed‚' ‘ verily z ’ e. g. here

and 734: sometimes further strengthened by etiam.

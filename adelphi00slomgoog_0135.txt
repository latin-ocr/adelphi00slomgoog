NOTES. LJNES 491-528· 97

514. si est is facturus. All MSS. read si est facturus, which re-
quires a most irregular hiatus between si est. Translate, ‘ if it prove

“ · that he is prepared to do his duty.' For a similar periphrasis cf. Phor.

270, Hec. 501.

Ac‘r IV. Setun 1.

Syrus ha'd sent off Demea, as he supposed, safely into the country, but
Ctesipho is alarmed at the possible consequences of the trick. Syrus is
suggesting a way out of the difficulty, when Demea appears in person,
having accidentally heard that Ctesipho is not at his country house.

517. dic, ‘tell me about it.’
sodon-si audes, ‘ if you please.’ Cf. 643, 766.

518. nuno quom maxumo, ⁴ now at this very moment) Cf. Andr.
823, Phor. 204. In all these cases, however, quom maxume might be
⁴ taken as qualifying the verb which follows, ·

utinam quidem, sc. ita sit.
519. quod,‘ as far as? Cf. 296 note.
velim, as a potential subjunctive, ‘I would wish: is followed in· .
differently by a pres. or perf. subj. or by an infinitive.
520. triduo hoc perpetuo‚‘ within three whole days from this?
521. istoc, abl. after rectius.
potis. Cf. 344. Syrus means, ‘ may he never get up again.’
ita, ‘just s0.’ Cf. 287 note.

522. misere, ‘ distractedly‚' similarly used as an intensive adverb in
667, 698. Terence often thus links together two adverbs.

523. male, also used intensively, e. g. Hec. 337.

525. revorti iterum, a pleonasm.

527. A reads Ecoxomrxro'm, etc. Many editors, considering that
the object of vidi must be expressed, have altered hodie to hoc ie, or
accepted the reading os the later MSS. quem egv hodie. The ellipse of
te, however, has a parallel in that of eum in 52 5 and in 608, the con·
text in both cases making the sense certain: while to pass from indirect
to direct speech, when the clauses are connected by a relative, would be
scarcely possible.

528. in mente est. Here Δ. has in mentem, all other MSS. in mente,
while in the parallel passage Heaut. 986 Δ. with D G read in mente, the
other MSS. in mentem. The MS. authority being so evenly balanced,
the reading most in harmony with ordinary syntax has been chosen.

numquam quicquam. Cf. 98 note.
tanto nequior, sc. cs, ‘the more fool yon.’

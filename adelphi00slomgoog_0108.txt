The juxtaposition of two words of the same root is common in
Terence, e. g. 20, 211-12, 322, 384, 668, 990. This is merely a special
form of assonance, and is to be distinguished from agnominatio or paro·
nomasia, which, strictly speaking, is a play upon words of similar sound
but different sense, something akin to a pun, e. g. Andr. 218 inceptio est
amentium, haud amantium. Paronomasia is fairly common in Plautus; ‘
but rare in Terence. The term is sometimes extended to a play upon
different meanings of the same word, such as is not uncommon in Cicer0.

in the phrase res convenit.

ADELPHI: CHARACTERS ΛΝΒ PLOT. xxiii

music-girl. By adroit lies Syrus turns all the 'facts to Ctesipho’s
credit, and in a scene of delicious humour first draws out and
then parodies the old man's soibles. Demea is about to seek
his son when (Se. 4) Geta brings up Hegio, who narrates the
supposed desertion of Pamphila by Aeschinus and declares his
intention of strenuously defending Sostrata and her daughter.
Demea departs to pour out the vials of his wrath on Micio.

In Aet IV. Scene 1, Ctesipho and Syrus are all but surprised
together by Demea, who returns from a fruitless search after
his brother, having been told'by a labourer that his errant son
had not been seen at the country-house. Syrus however (Sc. 2)
is equal to the occasion, and covering one lie by another sends
off Demea on a wild-goose chase after Micio, while he himself
retires to kill time with just a glass or two.

In the next scene (Sc. 3) Micio and Hegio come on con-
versing. In place of denials or evasions Hegio receives assur-
ances of most ample satisfaction, and Micio at once visits
Sostrata to allay her anxiety.

Scene 4 shows us Aeschinus, much distressed at the sus-
picions which have fallen upon him, yet unwilling to expose his
brother. He is about to enter Sostrata’s house when confronted
by Micio (Sc. 5), wh0, as a punishment for his want of confidence,
torments him with a feigned story about Pamphila’s intended
, marriage with another man. Aeschinus, unable to keep on the -
mask longer, bursts into tearS, whereupon Micio, after an affec·
tionate reproof, promises to acknowledge Pamphila as his wife.

Scene 6. Demea returns from his vain peregrination‚ angry and
scot-sore. Already boiling with indignation he is goaded almost
to madness (Sc. 7) by his brother’s cool indifference to all that
is most outrageous, and in this humour is found by Syrus, who
enters intoxicated (Sc. 8). His drunken insolence is interrupted
by a message from Ctesiph0, who is within. Dempar forces his
way into the house (Sc. 9), whence he bursts out up‘on Micio
with furious invective, though, as before, he is eventually reduced
by his brother’s readier tongue to an unwilling acquiescence.

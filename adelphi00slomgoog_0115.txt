difficnlt to decide between them. Cf. 537, 559.

172. ergo is often used as an emphasising particle, especially in
questions or imperative phrases. Cf. 324, 326, 572. ‘ Ι very much wish

40. 84, where the huckster's cry ‘ Cauneas’ (ficus) is represented as
identical in sound with cave ne eas. Ritschl, Proleg. 151-152, gives
numerous instances of a similar character.

174. peceato . . . , ‘ err on that side rather than on the other.’ The
so-called future imperative (used in laws, etc.) has a comical appropri-
ateness here, as if Aeschinus were laying down a general rule of

tamen. Cf. 110.

175. regnumne. Cf. Phor. 405 quandoquidem solus reg-nas et soli
licet, Pl. Trin. 695 quid? te dictatorem censes fhre . . . ? This can
hardly be considered as a distinctively Roman allusion, as a ‘ tyrant '

178. ferree. Cf. 106 note.

Terence in several senses: ,

254, 4327), {goa final particle, with the subjunctive—‘ in order that.’ Cf.
900· (3) As an interrogative adverb—⁴ how? ’ Cf. the present passage,
215, 8(941) As an indefinite particle with words of emphasis-‘ somehow’
(Gr. πως), e. g. hercle qui, edepol qui, quippe qui, et qui. Cf. 800 num qui.
(5) Introducing curses (πῶς, utinam), —‘ would that, ' ‘ O that. ' Cf. ’
Phor. 123, Pl. Trin. 923, 997.

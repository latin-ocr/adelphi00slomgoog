METRES AND PROSODY.

THE object of this Introduction is to explain briefly the metres
employed by Terence in the Adelphi‚ and to clear up such
apparent difficulties of Prosody as may remain after the general
scheme of the metres is understood. Α

These metres (with the exception of a Choriambic line 613)
are Iambic and Trochaic, which receive their names from being
composed of iambi or trocheeS, as the case may be, or of some
other feet, considered to be equivalent: and the lines are
further subdivided according to the number of metres which
they contain‚ and according to their complete or incomplete
form. In iambic and trochaic lines a series of two feet is called
a melre (or dipodia)‚ and the name of the line corresponds to
the number of these metres; thus an iambic trimeter is an
iambic line, containing three metres or six feet3 a trochaic
tetrameter is a trochaic line, containing four metres or eight
feet. Again, some lines have a number of complete feet ς these
are called acatalectic3 while others are called catalectic, be-
cause the last foot is incomplete. Thus a trochaic tetrameter
catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or eight feet, wanting
the last syllable, and really containing only seven feet and a

(b) Iambio 'I'etrameter Acataleotio, called octonarius,
from its eight complete feet. ‚ (186.)

(c) Iambio Tetrameter'cataleotio, called septenarius, from
its seven complete feet. (6.)

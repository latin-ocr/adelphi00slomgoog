NOTES. LINES 841-87 5. 1 ι 5

scisse, so A, the *other MSS. scire: but the perf. gives a good
sense, ‘which you may imagine that you have understood.’

860. prope iam excurso spatio, ‘ when now my course is almost
run! This metaphor from the racc-course as applied to life is found in
many authors, ancient and modern.

861. facilitate, ‘ affability.’

864. nulli laedere os, ‘to affront no·one to his face‚' ‘to tread on
no one’s corns.’ The infinitives here are historic, as in the parallel
passage Andr. 62 seqq. Cf. 45.

866. tristis, ‘ surly.’ cf. 79 note, Cic. de Sen. 5 65.

tenax, sc. rei, ‘ close-fisted.'
The original of the line is in Menander,
ἐγὼ δ’ ἀγροῖκος, ἐργάτης, σκνθρός, πικρός,
φειδωλός.

867. ibi, sc. in matrimonio. The troubles of the married man were
made the subject of fiequent jests on the Roman stage. Cf. 28-34, 43-4,
and especially the character of Nausistrata in the Phormio,

868. heia autem, ⁶ but heigh·ho t ’ probably meant as a translation
of ἀλλ’ εἷα. The Latin interjection is more clastic than the Greek.
For while εἶα is confined to stimulating exclamatiouS‚ ‘ come,’ ‘ up‚’
‘ away,’ etc., heia, also written eia, may express joy, surprise, ad·
miration, strong affirmatiou, ironical doubt, weariness‚ as here, and
so on.

870. exacta aetate, ‘at the end of my life?

fructi. Ῑιι Old Latin the Gen. of U· stems ended in -uos, A
form ιιι ·uis once occurs in Terence, Heaut. 287 anuis, but the Gen. in
-i, as though from an O-stem, is common. Only the form ιιι -as 1s used
by Augustan authorS, but Ennius, LucretiuS, Plautus, and Terence employ
both forms side by side. We find in Terence adventi, domi, fructi,
ornati, quaesti, tumulti. Neither Plautus nor Terence ever write domas
as the genitive. With hoc fructi compare hoc villi 786.

871. patria. Cf. 74 note.

potitur. In Terence potior is found three times constructed
with an accusative, once with an ablative ς cf. 876, Phor. 469, 830: in
Plautus with the acc„ abl„ or gen. Ovid Her. 14. 113 once writes
potitur, otherwise the i is always found short.

872. mi eredunt . . . Demea ignores the fact, which possibly Micio’s
nonchalance may have concealed from him, that Aeschinus kept his re-
lations with Pamphila a profound secret from his adopted father.

874. illum ut vivat optantsut ille vivat optant. Donatus notices
this as an archaism.

875. eductos. cf. 48 note.

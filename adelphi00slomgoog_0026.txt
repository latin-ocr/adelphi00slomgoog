xxji INTRODUCTJON.

low-bred bluster in Act 11 forms an admirable foil to the quiet
decision and contemptuous sarcasrn of the gentleman.

Before the action of the play begins both the young men had
fallen in love. Aeschinus indeed had been for nine months
secretly married to Pamphila, daughter of Sostrata, while
Ctesipho had formed an apparently hopeless attachment to a
music-girl who was a slave of Sannio. A son of Demea could
not be expected to have sufficient ready money to buy an expen-

boldly broke into the house and carried off the girl in spite of
her owner’s resistance. ‘ ’

Act I. It is just after this event that the curtain rises on
Micio, who, finding that Aeschinus has been absent from home

of that. Syrus is saved from the necessity of making rash
promises by the appearance of Ctesipho (Sc. 3), overjoyed at
the exploit of his brother, whom he presently (Se. 4) meets and
thanks most affectionately.

Act 111 introduces us to Sostrata, who is expressing her
anxiety to Canthara, her nurse, when Geta (Sc. 2) appearS,
violently agitated at the apparent unfaithfulness of Aeschinus
towards Pamphila. Sostrata resolves to appeal to Hegio, an
old friend of the family. Demea now reappears (Sc. 3), furious
at the news that Ctesipho is implicated in the abduction of the

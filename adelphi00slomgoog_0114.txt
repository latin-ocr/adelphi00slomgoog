appealing to, as a means of deterring Aeschinus, is not his position
as slave-dealer‚ which, though protected by law, was held in the
most utter contempt (cf. Pl. Rud. 651-3), but his excellent character
(mores), which would secure him justice before a court. The sense is,
‘I am a slave-dealer, it is true, but no man living ever bore a better
character.'

fide optuma, abl. of quality constructed with quisquam, which
is used because the sentence is virtually negative. In early Latin super-
latives were formed ih mmm. Julius Caesar is said to have introduced
the spelling ·imus.

165-6. Tho text gives the reading of A F P. This makes 165 a
trochaic tetrameter, and 166 an iambic tetrameter. This change of

to avoid it. But it should be noted that the metre changes from trochaic
tetrameters, 155-7, followed by one trochaic dimeter catalectic‚ v. 158,
to an iambic tetrameter in 1593 and in both cases the change coincides
with the actual or imputed words of Aeschinus, contrasted in their
measured tones with the excited utterance of Sanni0.

nollem factum, sc. esse, a form of apology. Cf. 162, 775, 919.

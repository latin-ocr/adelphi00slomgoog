allusion which is distinctively Roman. ¹ Indeed, the whole tone
of his writings was cosmopolitan. Human nature, under the
somewhat common-place conditions of every-day life in a
civilised community‚ was his subject; Homo sum, humani nihil
a me alienum pute, was his motto, His plays breathe a spirit
of broad-minded liberality, and their simple unaffected style,
, the easy yet pointed dialogue, the terse and dramatic descrip—
tions, and the admirable delicacy of the portrayal of character,

rude and unlettered masses who most enjoyed the broad fun of

a boisterous farce. The above characteristics secured for .

Terence considerable attention at the Renaissance in Europe.
In Englandfseveral of the minor dramatists are under obli-

Quidquid come loquens atque omnia dulcic‘z dicens.

Horace, Ep. 2. 1. 59, records the general verdict:

dicitur. κ

Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentzus arte.

VolcatiuS, on the other hand, places Terence below Naevius, Plautus,

Caecilius, Licinius, and Atilius.

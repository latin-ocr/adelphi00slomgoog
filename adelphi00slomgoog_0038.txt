The Bembine is by far the most important, not merely on
account of its antiquity, but because it alone has escaped the
recension of Calliopius in the seventh century. Codex A was
in bad condition, as its owner Cardinal Bembo testified before
the end of the fifteenth century. Andria 1-786 is now entirely
wanting, and of Adelphi 914-997 only a few letters are legible.

It bears a note written by Politian (1493 A.D.) to the effect
that he never saw so old a Codex. The hands of two correctors
can be discerned: one of ancient date, which only appears twice
in the Andria, and never in the Phormio or Adelphi; the other
about the fifteenth century, which changed and added characters
in a ‘ downright shameless fashion.’ But, where not thus tam-
pered with, Codex A possesses an authority sufficient to out—
weigh all the other MSS. taken together. The later MSS.
were so much altered by the Calliopian recension that their in-
dependent authority is not very great. In all MSS., even in A,
the spelling has been much modernised.

The evidence of the MSS. is to some extent supplemented
by quotations of ancient writers and the commentaries of
grammat-iaus. ⁶

of these latter, the most important is Aelius Donatus, tutor of
St. Jerome, about 350 A.D., and author of a celebrated gram-
matical treatise which became the common text—book of rnedi-
aeval schools. Priscian (480 ἓ Α.1).), Servius (about 420 ΛΦ.) in
his notes on Vergil, and other more obscure scholiasts are of

occasional service.

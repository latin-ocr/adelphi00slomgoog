day life. The quantity of any syllable was regarded as rigidly
fixed‚ just as we might find it marked in a dictionary. But in
reading the cornic poets we find that accent must be considered
as well as quantity. Scansion was determined by the ear, not
by any hard and fast ruleS. Just as in Shakesperian verse loved
may be scanned as of one syllable or of tWO, and the same word
may be pronounced as long or short according to its position, so
in Terence eius, huius, quotae, ete„ may be monosyllabic or
dissyllabiq and the same syllable may be used with a different
quantity according to the requirements of the metre. This
latter variation of quantity is however not arbitram, but conforrns
to a general laW, which may be thus stated.

When the metrieal aecent1 falls on the first syllable of an
Iambus, or on the syllable before or after an Iambus in
the same foot, the second syllable of the Iambus may be
shortened.

Accordingly in Iambic mette,

(a)-x.'J-=—x.')u, (b) u—sszvussz
in Trochaic metre, (c) -'- υ- -- -ὐ υ,
(d) ύ--Ξύυ-,Ιω ύ-υεύυυ.

It will be noted that in the following ,examples some of the
shortened syllables would by the ordinary rules be long by
nature, others long by position.

(a) 239 labdscit. tinum hoc kdbeo .· vz'a'e5 si scitis place‘t.

605 omne‘S, quz'bz'c‘s re's sunt mz'nz‘c‘s secandae, mdgi's sunt,
ne'sc'io quo' modd.

(b) 73 stude‘t pcir rqf'drre.
638 quid kuic hic negdti est.
900 studlntfdcere (in a proceleusmatic).

, This form of shortening, i. e. where the metrical accent falls on
the syllable aster the iambuS, is by far the most frequent.

¹ In Iambic metre the accent falls on the second syllable of all feet
except anapaests and proceleusmafics, which are accented on the third ε
in Trochaie metre the accent is always on the first syllable.

19. vobis univorsis, ⁸ all of you,' i. e. the audienee.

populo, ‘ the public,’ i. e. the Roman people generally.

so. in otio, ‘ at leisure,’ especially for literary pursuits, opposed to
both in bello and in negotio.

21. Translate, ‘ no one disdains to use at his own convenience.’ The
argument is, ⁸ no one is too proud to avail himself of the services of
these great men in other matters3 why should 1 in composing my
plays P To connect sine superbia with homines nobilis is not only
opposed to the collocation of the words, but also to the sense.

22. dehinc, always monosyllabic in Terence.

²3· ii, the reading of Δ. with D G P. Most editors, following
Ritschl on Pl. Trin. 17 (Prolegomena 98), print i or ei. Priscian says
that ii was pronounced as one syllable. Lines ²²-3 are almost verbally
identical with Pl. Trin. 16-7. '

24. ostendent, sc. actores. Terence not unfrequently leaves a snb-
ject to be supplied, when the sense is obvious, especially if the verb be
in the infinitive‚ e. g. 52. Cf. 77 note.

aequanimitas, ‘ your kind attention: ' cf. Andr. 24, Heaut. 3 5,
Phor. 30 adeste aequo animo.

25. augeat. Ritschl (Proleg. 180-3) shows that the singular ter-
minations of the preS. subj. act. and the 1st pers. sing. of pres. subj.

Ac‘r Ι. SCENE 1.

Micio calls for Storax, one of the slaves sent the night before to
escort his adopted son Aeschinus home from supper. Receiving no
answer, he supposes that they have not returned, and proceeds to
moralise on the anxieties of a parent and the best system of education.

27. servolorum, etc. Donatus tells us that slaves to whom this
duty was assigned were called advorsitores. The diminutive servoli
is used in a similar connexion Andr. 83. Cf. 566.

ierant, as Phor. 573 audieras, Hec. 813 audierit, but 127 abfero.
So Terence uses fierem and flerem.

28. absis. Note this indefinite use of the and person in colloquial
1anguage, just as in English.

29—30. Ritschl considers aut ibi si cesses and et quae in animo
cogitat as spuriouS, and reads but one line,

Quae in te uxor dicit, evenire ea satius est. .
All MSS. however have the words, and there is some point in the idea
of the angry wife who says something, but thinks a good deal more.

I have to thank my former fellow-worker‚ C. E. Freernan,
Esq.‚ of Park House School, Southborough‚ to whose
accurate scholarship our editions of the Trz'nummus and

also express my obligations to the Rev. R. F. Dale for his
kindness in reading the proof-sheets and making some
valuable suggestionS.'

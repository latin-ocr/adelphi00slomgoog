No TES. LJNES 19-4 5. 69

ibi, sc. uspiam.
in te rather than de te, expressing the spiteful intent of the words.

31. propitii, ⁴ loving ε ’ more commonly used of deitieS.

33. animo obsequi, ‘ to make merry,’ lita to follow one’s inclina·
tionsz’ cf. Pl. Mil. Gl. 677 es, bibe, animo obsequere mecum, atque
onera te hilaritudine. Similar phrases are animum explere, animo
morem gerere ,· cf. Andr. 188, 641.

34„ soli, ‘ left all alone: ’ this seems better than to connect soli with '

tibi. The line is wanting in Δ..

35. 6ςό quia, a proceleusmatic. See Introduction xxvi.

37-8. The'text gives the MSS. reading. Fleckeisen follows Ritschl’s
conjectural emendation (Proleg. 120),

Aut cecicterit aliqua atque aliquid praefregerit.

Vah! quemquamne hominem in animum instituere aut sibi . . .

quemquamne, etc. Terence often uses the acc. aud inf. to
express indignant or excited questions and exclamatione: ⁸ to think that
any man . . .’

-ne is frequently found in such sentences, because a question is
implied if not expressed: cf. 304 note, 237, 330, 390, 408, 4492 56²2
610, 629. Ι

in animum instituere. ⁶ should take it into his head?

39. parare is dependent on in animum instituere.

40. atque, ‘ and yet‚’ ==the later atqui. This adversative sense is not
uncommon in Terence, e. g. 362, Andr. 22 5, etc.

tratre ex meo. The reading is doubtful. Donatus apparently read
ex fratre, is adeo Dissimili studio.

41. iam inde ab adulescentia. Cf. 962 usque a pueris.

42. elementem, ‘ easy-going.’

43. quod, sc. uxorem non habere.

isti, ‘ those who are not like me,’ ‘my married friends? This
is better than to understand quod = uxorem habere, and isti, as ‘ those
who differ from me.'

44. eontra. Many editorS, believing that contra is not used as a
preposition as early as Terence, put a stop after omnia, and suppose an
ellipse of agit or some such word. But, though the adverbial use is
much more common, e. g. 50, contra is found as an undoubted pre—
position Pl. Pa. 155 adsistite omnes contra me, ib. Pers. 1. 1. 13,
and it is far more natural to take it as such here and in the parallel
passage, Phor. 5²1 nunc contra omnia haec Repperi qui det neque
lacrumet.

45. agere, historic infinitive, a marked characteristic of Terence’s
style. Here he even uses agere and habere as coordinate with duxit.

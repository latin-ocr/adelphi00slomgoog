1 1 2 ADELPHI.

797. ex te adeo est ortum, ‘it was from you yourself that the pro·
posal came.’ Cf. 629 note. For the proposal in question see 129—132.
799. recipis, ‘ harbour.’ Cf. Cic. Mil. 19. 50 praedatum receptor.

800. :num qui. Cf. 179 note.

801. The order is num⁴ qui minus aequom est idem ius mihi (tecum)
esse quod mecum est tibi ,⁹ ⁸ Is it in any way less just. . . ’

802. ne eura. Cf. 279 note.

803. verbum, ‘ proverb.² Cf. Andr. 426 verum illud verbum est,
volgo quod dici solet.

804. eommunia . . . omnia, Gr. κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων, said to be a
Pythagorean maxim. It is quoted in Latin by Cicero de Off. 1. 16. 51 ;
in Greek by Plato Lysis, 207 C, Aristotle Eth. Nic. 8. 9. 1, Martial, 2.
43. 1 and 16.

806. ausculta paucis, sc. verbis. The analogy of Andr. 29 paucis te
vole, Pl. Trin. 96 3 te tribus verbis volo, etc„ makes it more probable that
paucis is here an ablative than a dative. The same phrase occurs Andr. 536.

807. sumptum, attracted into the case of the relative. This ‘inverse
attraction’ is not uncommon in Terence -when the antecedent is placed
in the relative clause, e. g. Andr. 3, ib. 26.

808. hoo is object of cogites.

809. pro re tollebas tua, ‘you were bringing up according to your
means! At Rome it was the eustom to lay a new-born infant at the
feet of its father, who raised it in his arms if he wished to acknowledge
it. Hence tollere=(a) to acknowledgeas one’s child, (b) to bring up as
, one’s child. Cf. Andr. 219 quidquid peperisset, decreverunt tollere.

812. antiquam. Cf. 44² note, Andr. 817.

obtine, ‘keep to.' Note that obtinereaeadipisci, ‘to obtain,’ is·
not found before Cicero, and is not at all common in any writer.

813. conserva, quaere, parce, ‘ heard, serape, and save!

814. gloriam tu istam obtine: so A and D (first hand). If the
reading be correct the awkward repetition of obtine, 812 and 814, as of
benefacis 601 and 604, are almost the only instances of careless writing
in this most polished of Terence’s plays.

815. mea . . . utantur. Terence elsewhere constructa utor with an
ablative, but abutor with an accusative. Cf. 464 note. Here the acc.
might be due to ‘ inverse attraction.'

evenere, ‘ has come in to them.'

816. de summa nil decedit, ‘ there is no diminution of your capital.’

Calliopian MSS. decedet.
hino, i.e. from my fortune.

817. de luero, ‘ as clear gain? The preposition de often signifiea the

whole from which a part is taken.

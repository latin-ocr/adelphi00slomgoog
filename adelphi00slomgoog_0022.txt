xviii IN TROD UC TION.

sons and an intriguing slave3 two young men, one of strong
character and the other weak, both amorous and somewhat
unscrupulous as to the means of gratifying their passion3 a
dignified and elderly gentleman ; an anxious mother 3 a devoted
servant3 a rascally slave deafer: these form the stock characters
of Terentian comedy and recur with somewhat wearisome
monotony. Nor does the standard of morality rise above 'a
conventional respectability and a civilised consideration for
others, except where the natural impulses inspire a generous

· disposition with something of nobility.

The discerning criticism of Caesar nearly expresses the more
matured judgment of modern times:

Tu quoque, tu m summis, O dtmidiate Menander,
Ponert's et merite, puri sermonis amator.

Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis

C amica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore

Cum Graecis neque in hac despectus parte iaceres;
Unum stoc maceror ac doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Not that Terence was devoid of humour3 but his humour is so
delicate and refined thatit must often have fallen flat upon the
stage. When his plays are well known their subtle satire and
polished wit can be appreciated; but there is without doubt an
absence of energy and action (Caesar’s vis comica), which
prevented his pieces from being dramatically successful. An
audience must be educated up to his plays before it can perceive
their many excellences.

xxxii INTROD UCTION.

1Intensive particleS, free use of, adeo 629, autem 185, enim
and nam 168, ergo 172, etiam 550, and the prefixes, dis-
3552 per· 393·

illi= illic, 1 16.

ilice, perhaps of place, 156.

Besides these differences in Accidence and Syntax the plays
of Terence abound, as is natural, in words or phrases used in a
colloquial sense, e. g. 109, 123, 133, 172, 202, 204, 220, 228,
282,etc.; in tautologous and pleonastic expressions, e. g. 111,
224, 259, 294, 366, ete. ; in a free use of Ellipse, e. g. 24, 51, 52,
76, 77, 227, 330, etc.; and in proverbial sayingS, e. g. 537, 804,
958·

Of Greek words there are comparatively few, mina 370, pa-
trisso 564, parasitastery79, hymenaeum 905, euge 91 1.

It should however be borne in mind that most of the above
points are characteristic not so much of Terence individually as
of the conversational language in common use at that period;
and when writers of later date descend from the artificial style
adopted in the literary productioris of the Ciceronian or Augustan
age—as for example Cicero in his Letters—rnany of these so·
called peculiarities re-appear.

¹ In the use of Intensive Particles Vergil‘s styl‘e presents marked
similarities with that of Terence.

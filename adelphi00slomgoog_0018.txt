Plautus and Terence. Between 230 and 160 B.c. the writers
of Comedy were fairly numerous ¹, but only two have bequeathed
to posterity more than scattered fragments. These two are
Titus Maccius Plautus and Publius Terentius Afer.

Life and Works of Terence. Plautus died in 184 Re.
Terence was born in 195 B.C. at Carthage, whence his cognomen
‘Afer.’ He was a slave, but must early have shown signs of
ability, for his master, Terentius Lucanus, gave him a good
education, and before long his freedom. His talents -gained
him admission to the literary clique‚ known as the Scipionic
circle,. the fashionable representatives of the new Hellenic
culture. Scipio Aemilianus was the centre of the coterie, which
included Laelius and Furius Philus, Sulpicius GalluS‚ Q. Fabius
Labe0, Μ. PopilliuS‚ the philosopher Panaetius, and the historian
Polybius· These being men of education and taste‚ unre-
servedly recognised the immeasurable superiority of Greek
literature as compared with the rude efforts of their native
writers, To present to a Roman audience a faithful reproduc-
tion of the best Hellenic modeIS, in pure and polished'Latim
seemed to them the ideal of literary excellence. Style was more
valued than strength, correctness of form more than originality
of thought. Such was the literary atmosphere which Terence
breathed; and his enemies, not confining themselves to gross
aspersions on his moral character, openly affirmed that the
plays produced under his name were really the work of his dis-
tinguished patronS. How far Scipio or Laelius may have had
some hand in his plays can never be known ; Terence at any rate
did not care to refute the report which doubtless fiattered his
noble fn'endS, but rather prided himself on the intimacy and
approbation of so select a circle ². All the plays of Terence, as

¹ e. g. Caecilius, Licinius, Atilius, and others. Ennius, whose farne
rests on his Epic poem, also adapted Greek plays, chiefly tragedieS‚ to
the Roman stage.

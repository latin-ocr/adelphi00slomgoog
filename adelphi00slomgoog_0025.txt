ADELPHJ: ‘CHARACTERS AND PLOT. xxi

with a music-girl, while Demea is still living in his fool’s
paradise. - .

These events open Demea’s eyes to the truth. He sees that
his own extreme strictness and Micio's over-indulgence have
been alike mistaken. In Act V he demonstrates the shallowness
of Micio’s views by a delightfully humorous reductio ad absur-

Canthara, both servants of Sostrata.

Hegio is a gentleman of the old school, poor indeed, but
dignified‚ and of unswerving fidelity towards the widow of his old
friend ; while Sostrata excites our real sympathy by her devoted
affection and courageous honesty of purpose.

Sannio, the slave-dealer, is mercenary and repulsive. His
